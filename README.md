## Purpose:

There are many 'boilerplate' starter projects out there, however I have not yet found one that uses all the parts of my preferred stack. This project is meant to fill that void.

## Tooling: 

* Typescript
* React
* React-redux
* React-router
* webpack
* react-flexbox-grid (responsive grid based layouts)
* sass
* fetch wrappers (for restful API calls)
* tslint (with a few rules modified from the defaults)
* browser-bunyan for centralized logging
* font awesome

## Developer Notes:

previously I had used a custom flux model. This is my first dive into react-redux, and I learned most of what I know from the following guide (and supplimentary example project)

* https://rjzaworski.com/2016/08/typescript-redux-and-react
* https://github.com/rjz/typescript-react-redux

I am by no means a frontend / UI expert, so this project is geared to help me learn responsive design patterns with flexbox and sass.

I intend to add a unit test suite soon

Maybe sometime soon I'll have a matching backend boilerplate project to contribute as well, although there are fewer moving parts to choose from. It is likely there are already example projects out there using typescript, express, and whatever database solution fits the immediate need.
