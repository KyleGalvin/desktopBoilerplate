## Purpose:

There are many 'boilerplate' starter projects out there, however I have not yet found one that uses all the parts of my preferred stack. This project is meant to fill that void.

## Tooling: 

* Typescript
* React
* React-redux
* webpack
* react-flexbox-grid (grid based layouts)
* sass
* fetch wrappers (for restful API calls)
* tslint (with a few rules modified from the defaults)

## Developer Notes:

previously I had used a custom flux model. This is my first dive into react-redux, and I learned most of what I know from the following guide (and supplimentary example project)

* https://rjzaworski.com/2016/08/typescript-redux-and-react
* https://github.com/rjz/typescript-react-redux

I am by no means a frontend / UI expert, so this project is geared to help me learn responsive design patterns with flexbox and sass.

I intend to add a unit test suite soon

I currently have no idea what redux-thunk is. It was simply used in a guide and things didn't work without it

Maybe sometime soon I'll have a matching backend boilerplate project to contribute as well, although there are fewer moving parts to choose from. It is likely there are already example projects out there using typescript, express, and whatever database solution fits the immediate need.
